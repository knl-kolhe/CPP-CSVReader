# CPP-CSVReader
This is a custom C++ CSV reader I modified for my use. 
The code is based on the CSV mentioned over here: https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/reading-and-writing-csv-files-with-cpp/

I just added STL so that you can read whatever datatype you need.

The Reader.cpp contains the class definition for the reader and the main.cpp contains an example of the CSV reader.
